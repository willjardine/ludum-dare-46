# Ludum Dare 46: Keep It Alive

This is my third game jam and I'm using:

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [SoundGrid](https://apps.apple.com/app/id316521221)
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)

It looks like I spent 17.81 hours working on this.
